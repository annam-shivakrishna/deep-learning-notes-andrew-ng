Supervised Learning 

Structured data & Unstructured data

Structured data
1. Each of features size,bedrooms,price will be having meaning
2.House Prediction
3.Advertising 

Unstructured data
1.Images
2.Voice 
3.Text

Why Deep learning working well?

the graph Amount of data vs Performance 

Traditional Algorithm 
Given more data don't know what to do
Small NN Performance will improve
Medium NN performance better than small NN
large NN performance is best

Labeled data

switching from sigmoid function to relu function gradient descent makes much faster
idea -----.> code -------> experiments
